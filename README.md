# WISH (Woefully Inadequate SHell)

This is a project from TDT4186 at NTNU. It is a fully working Linux terminal created in C. There is no variable colors or anything fancy like that, but it has all the functionality of a Linux terminal. In theory it should work on any UNIX system, but I did have some issues on Mac. 

I have kind of abandoned this project after the semester finished, but at some point I might get back to it and add some improvements.
